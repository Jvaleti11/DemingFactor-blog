### Step 1. Make a time to meet. 

One of our commitments to you is that we are easy to work with. Start by booking a free no-obligation video consultation. Maybe you're ready to get started on your project, maybe you are just curious at this stage. Either way perfectly fine. 

You can easily check availability and book a time here: [https://calendly.com/demingfactor/free-initial-consultation](https://calendly.com/demingfactor/free-initial-consultation "check availability and book a time here")

Just reach out and lets make a time to chat, either face-to-face or via a video call. Usually we can offer good advice even in that first meeting and most people then ask us to prepare a proposal based around your rough budget.

### Step 2. You talk we listen.

Sure we're happy to tell you all about our services and how we can help you. We've found that the best way to get started is for you to just give us the whole picture. Get it off your chest. Your plans, hopes, concerns, requirements, all of it.

By giving you space to unpack the challenges and goals of your project we also build a solid understand of who you are and what you're wanting to achieve. 

### Step 3. We prepare a proposal

We debrief as a team, unpack what has been discussed, envisage the future and create a proposal for you.

As Media Designers we work across different mediums of design, from print to web to animated graphics. Once upon a time a designer knew how their designs were going to be displayed, on which publication/paper size and when. Now integrating traditional graphic design with modern digital marketing as well as animated motion design is creating a more complex environment, one that brings new challenges and new opportunities to those that can look beyond. We help you develop a Brand Focus which can be used across many different media. With this approach, future creative endeavours by graphic designers, web designers, photographers, interior designers, animators are all working towards the same objective.  This process doesn't take us long, but it has a significant impact on ensuring all your visual communication starts working together and really working for you.

### Step 4. Discuss our proposal

We meet again and we take you through our proposal and discuss how to make the project really work well.

### Step 5. You choose to go ahead

### Step 6. Strategic Positioning Workshop

### Step 7. Design and Creation

### Step 8. Delivery

### Step 9. Retrospective Debrief

#### What works best. 

One mistake we commonly see people make when hiring creatives, is that the creative is just the arm of the process. What works best is when you get really clear what the outcome you are wanting is and not get too attached to a specific way of achieving that outcome. Smart clients take this approach and as a result unlock more passion and creativity from the creatives they hire.What you can do to prepare?We usually run through this with clients ourselves, so consider this a sneak peek. But the killer question we always ask is "What does your ideal customer look like?", it can be harder than you think. We've found the clearer you can get on imaging who they are the clearer becomes your whole organisational focus.How can I eek every last bit of value out of working with a DesignerDesigners design to constraints. Get clear on What problem you really want us to solve and spend time for yourself unpacking what the problem is. Share that clearly and you'll maximise your results. Unclear on all of it, that's all good, that's part of why we're here and our approach in helping you unpack this.We’d love to hear from youWe hope that this has given you a better idea of working with designers and working with our team specifically. We’d love to hear about your project, drop us a line and lets chat further.
