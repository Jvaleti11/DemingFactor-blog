'Star Wars Episode 8 opens today, Thursday Dec 14th 2017. <br><br>Team
DemingFactor
  are heading along to an opening night screening later today. We really love the
  new poster so thought this is a good opportunity to unpack the design.<br><br><strong><img
  src="/uploads/2017/12/14/star-wars-8-poster-analysis.jpg"></strong><br>The poster
  is firstly striking for its constraint and minimalist styling. Star Wars posters
  often have stacks of characters, ships and weapons all packed into the scene so
  it’s lovely to see such a clean design.<br><br>A few subtle hat tips have been made
  to the original 1977 design.<br>Ray holds her lightsaber aloft directly reminiscent
  of the original Star Wars poster from 1977.<br><br>Gone is the sexy leg shot and
  awkward robes, the female is now the hero while wearing clothing better suited to
  fighting oppressive space overlords.<br><br>Further the white space around the poster
  and the rounded corners (reminiscent of other classic posters from the 1970’s) tells
  us that this story is about staying true to Star Wars roots. Lending weight to the
  theory that this will be the movie where the dark side wins out (aka Ep. 2 - Empire
  Strikes Back)<br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8gWrEvJsLdsUtcz2ILqCkBDgmuM321I3lPWk74Qsb-IS9W5AXBhrf6QwZIk5Xrd658FYF5XNc-4tSP-CNB3Q7o25-Q9eyv0OXPs47959s8zLjiI9BxlxgtrCleA0MxVI3eWIqDwq"
  width="447" height="657"><br>Ray’s lightsaber also does a lovely job of drawing
  the eye and visually dividing the page. Looking closely, her lightsaber transitions
  from blue (used by Jedi and Sith alike) to red (used only by the dark side)... Is
  Ray destined for the Dark Side this time around?<br><br>Finally the red background
  that washes over Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren implies blood, battles and passion.
  Interpretation: This movie will be an emotional rollercoaster and maybe Luke will
  lose himself to anger.<br><br>Finally with Ray standing holding a lightsaber with
  legs strongly apart, basically standing on the title text below, confirms visually
  that the poster wants us to know that Ray is the Last Jedi.<br><br>For those playing
  along at home this poster is an immediate tease, either as the poster implies -
  Ray is the Last Jedi, in which case Luke is destined to die. Otherwise Ray is destined
  for the Dark Side leaving Luke as the Last Jedi. <br><br>The only way to know is
  to head along to the movie to find out what happens. Which we’ll be doing as a team
  later tonight.<br><br>May the force be with you.<br>Team DemingFactor
